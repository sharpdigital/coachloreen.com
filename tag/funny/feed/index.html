				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Without a doubt we all have our own unique approach to training; from why we train to the mentality we adopt while we train. The Training Philosophy Series will showcase a range of people who will share with us their own methods of training, what they love about training, what they find challenging, what helps them push through the pain barrier and some of the lighter moments they&#8217;ve experienced during their training sessions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kicking us off is 24 year-old Elliot Charles, professional footballer and personal trainer based in North London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How I got into training:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was always very sporty at school, representing my school and county in athletics.  I also played football but didn&#8217;t really take it too seriously until around 16/17 when I got into it more and it paid off as I turned pro at the age of 18.  I now play for Dover FC and the Grenadian national team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Methods &amp; Philosophy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-261 alignright" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4-300x200.jpg" alt="EC4" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4-300x200.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I train a different part of my body every day but while some people might do the same body part on a set day of the week, I change what days I do each muscle from week to week.  I find this works my muscles more efficiently and it also makes training less predictable and more fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Favourite aspect of training (self)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love training my legs. Despite the pain the following day, I just love the buzz I get from pushing myself to do another set. Somehow, training my legs releases a mad level of endorphins that training other parts of me doesn&#8217;t. On the other hand, I just don&#8217;t love training my core and abs as much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Favourite aspect of training (for football)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I <img class="  wp-image-259 alignright" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-300x300.jpg" alt="EC2" width="243" height="243" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-49x49.jpg 49w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-130x130.jpg 130w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" />love the technical aspect of football training. I find this part of training much more relevant to my development as a footballer than the long running drills we often do. I get that the running improves my heart rate and endurance, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But I just prefer spending time on practicing specific skills and techniques required in playing a world-class standard of football and just love having the ball at my feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Funniest thing I&#8217;ve seen while training</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-258 alignleft" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1-300x208.jpg" alt="EC1" width="300" height="208" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1-300x208.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ll never forget the time a guy was clearly showing off, trying to bench press what was obviously more than his maximum.  Next thing we all heard him screaming for help as he struggled to bring the barbell under control.  One of us had to rush over and help him to stop him almost killing himself with the weights.  I know really shouldn&#8217;t but I just wanted to cry with laughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nightmare kind of trainee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People who appear to &#8216;tire&#8217; easily and lack any real focus on &#8216;the job at hand&#8217; &#8211;  you know the kind of person who loves to take a break at the smallest sign of fatigue.  This disrupts the flow of the session and makes it hard to achieve fitness and training goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Idol</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My team-mate Terrell, who used to play in the premier league, still trains with the same dedication and focus you would expect of someone playing in the top flight.  He&#8217;s the first one in, last one to leave and gives more than 100% each session.  He is tireless in the practice and honing of his craft, is a great player and motivates me to do my best too.  His attitude, respect for his team and work rate is truly inspirational.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Fuel</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I eat a protein rich diet consisting of chicken, fresh greens and healthy, unprocessed starches. I mainly drink water and juice.</p>
