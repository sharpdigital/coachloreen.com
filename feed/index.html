The clock counted down, we all hugged, raised our glasses and wished each other a happy new year. Another year dawns and signals the clamour of self flagellation and semi panic worldwide as people resolve to change something or finally do that thing they planned to do X years ago. I used to be part of this well-meaning bunch who promised themselves and those around them that this new year would be different. It would be better. Of course lots of people manage to keep that resolve for a while before ditching it altogether. Psychologically, the need to be part of a mass decision-making hub is totally understandable. Makes you feel as if you’re fulfilling an unwritten global urge to make a change.</p>
<p>But why wait until the 31st day of the last month of any year or the 1st day of the first month of any year? You must realise by now that you just set yourself up to potentially fail (granted this doesn’t apply to everyone) or put unnecessary pressure on yourself to be defined by 12 arbitrary months. But that’s just how I have come to view the whole tradition of new year’s resolutions.</p>
<p>So what does a coach like me do instead? Well I start the first month of every year with a plan of what I need to do in the coming months; based on what I was trying to achieve the year before. I review how I got on with the previous year’s plans in terms of what goals still serve a purpose for me now, what else I need to do to accomplish that goal and what other goals I need to set to get closer to my ultimate long-term goal. Which then squarely forces me to identify and establish what that long-term goal should be! You see, we make goals all the time feeling at the time as if that thing we want to achieve is important.</p>
<p>That decision is often guided by things going on in our life at that point. If you periodically revisit that arch goal, you may realise that it isn’t serving your own greater good. It (the goal) may have ceased to matter. But because you are committed to seeing it through, you carry on regardless. Fast forward to new year’s eve and you may feel unaccomplished if you didn’t manage to achieve that goal, the very goal that wasn’t really any use to you anyway. For example, you may have wanted to stop drinking, lose weight, stop hanging out with that friend that drains you or change that job you hate. I’m not saying those goals don’t matter. Yet once you really examine why you set those goals in the first place, you might find that it isn’t the most important change you need to make at that point in your life.</p>
<p>Instead, continuously look at the changes you want to make and ask yourself why. What will that change do for you. What will it not do. Does it matter if you don’t make that change. How important is it for you to make that change. How hard are you willing to work to get that thing you want? Answer those questions and you will find your direction. The last two questions will also show you that you don’t need to wait until new year’s eve to make that resolve to change. Change is continous. All year round. It can start in February. August. November. The main thing is to understand the purpose of the goal you’re setting, decide how important it is, make a plan, stick some dates in the plan so you are accountable and have fun realising the dream you wrote for yoursel.</p>
<p>Happy 2017!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Breast-lump/PublishingImages/AGCTTY_342x198.jpg" alt="" /></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The recent discovery of an unusual lumpy mass in my right breast had me running superfast to my doctors who referred me to the hospital for a scan.  I got an appointment very quickly and the scan identified the lumpy mass to be hormonal cysts. Nothing to worry about, no real definitive causes and no real cures according to the consultants but the holistic warrior in me wanted to know more so I dug further. Here are 10 things you should know about unusual lumps in your breasts:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs and are common in women aged 35-50 years (although younger women and men can also get them)</p>
<p><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span><span style="text-align: justify;">Although no specific causes can be cited for definite, hormonal changes in the body are thought to be the most common cause of benign (i.e. non-cancerous) lumps in breasts</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Benign breast lumps do not increase your risk of nor develop into breast cancer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Some people with cysts may not feel any symptoms and others may feel symptoms ranging from pain in either breast, sunken nipples, dimpling on the skin of the breast, a rash on or around the nipple or a change in the size of  the breast</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>The size of the cysts vary from miniscule to several centimetres in diameter. It is also possible to have one or several cysts in one or both breasts</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Screening is a simple process involving an ultrasound scan, mammogram and in some cases inspiration of the cyst (where sample tissue is taken and further examined)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>It is thought that reducing your intake of caffeine, chocolate and fatty or fried foods can improve the condition.  There are also a lot of studies that link breast cancer to dioxin (an environmental pollutant) and other heavy metals we are exposed to on a daily basis as these pollutants tend to accumulate in fatty tissue. Avoid drinking water and soft drinks sold in plastic bottles and where possible use skincare products that contain no parabens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Other holistic remedies include increasing intake of vitamin E, evening primrose oil, iodine and vitamin B6 which is particularly good for liver function. An impaired liver function can mean an excess of hormones in the body which can be stored as, for example, cysts in the breast</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Therapeutic massages such as the Tibetan breast massage stimulates the endocrine system to balance the female hormones as well as keeping the tissue from getting overly congested</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Regularly feel your breasts, either in the shower/bath or during the moisturising part of your beauty regime. This is your best chance at spotting any changes in the shape etc of your breasts. Some changes are a natural part of whatever is going on in your life at that time (pregnancy, monthly cycle, aging etc) and some changes need medical attention. The only way to know for sure is to get it checked out and quickly!</p>
<p><span style="color: #545454;">☯ </span>Early diagnosis could be live saving.  More info can be found from the NHS&#8217;s website here:  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Breast-lump/Pages/Introduction.aspx</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since my scan, I stopped drinking cocoa every night, stopped drinking my beloved Earl Grey tea, ate less chicken and used even less oil in my cooking than I already did.  Why? Well the first three items are known to be high in compounds that interfere with hormone levels in the body and too much fat in your diet can put your liver under stress which means it works less effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also started taking evening primrose oil, a B vitamin complex and Omega oils supplements.  I also did a juice cleanse using different combinations of ginger, beetroot, mint, celery and turmeric along with green leafy vegetables.  Within a few weeks of making these changes, the unusual lump in my breast has completely disappeared!! I can&#8217;t believe it either. Clearly I needed to clean out my organs&#8230;..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a class="thirstylink" title="HN omega" href="http://coachloreen.com/recommends/hn-omega/" target="_blank"><img class="thirstylinkimg" title="HN omega" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/large_1_20140415_112509_complete-omegas-QEO.jpg" alt="HN omega" width="163" height="277" /></a> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to watch my younger sister every year, suffering with wretched symptoms of hayfever and feel so bad for her. Her eyes would literally puff up like a frog from the constant itch scratch cycle and then she would constantly slap at her ears to try and relieve the itching in her inner ear canal. Then when I was in my early 20s, I also started experiencing this miserable condition. Both my babies were born in spring which meant I was breasfeeding during the summer and couldn’t take any anti-histamines.  Since then I have been looking at alternative remedies and ways of reversing my symptoms. After all, I wasn’t born with this!</p>
<p>First I looked at why some of us are afflicted with this allergy while others just blithely go through every summer without one sneeze or itch.</p>
<p>Our body’s symptomatic reaction as hay fever occurs when the immune system mistakes airborne substances such as dust, pollen and pollution as a threat.  Our body then produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E to attack what it thinks are harmful substances trying to come inside it. It then releases the chemical histamine which causes the itching, runny nose and watery eyes etc. This is the body’s way of trying to get rid of what it thinks are toxins.<br />
There are seasonal hay fever triggers which include pollen and spores that will cause symptoms during certain months of the year as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>◊ Tree pollen tends to affect people between March and June</p>
<p>◊ Grass pollen tends to affect people between May and September</p>
<p>◊ Weed pollen tends to affect people in the autumn (fall)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, those of us living in the city, especially fairly green and leafy cities such as London, can suffer worse than those in the country as the heat and fumes from cars can trap pollen in the atmosphere.  Combine the presence of numerous high rise buildings and warm, dry, airless weather and you get a situation where these pesky pollen have no way of dispersing into the atmosphere as they normally would so they fall down on us instead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, as the summer has been so late in coming in the UK, experts say there is an even greater buildup of pollen in the atmosphere and predict this summer to be the worst for hayfever in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturopaths and nutritionists believe that one of the main reasons a quarter of the population suffers from this allergy is due to a weak immune system, directly linked to excess toxins in the digestive system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can you do about all this? Well for a start you can take note of foods you eat that are high in histamine. It makes sense to steer clear of these foods especially during the allergy season so that you don’t add to the histamine your body will try and produce in response to pollen attacking it.</p>
<p><strong>Below is a list of some of the common foods that are high in histamine:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Pickled, tinned, canned, preserved foods</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Cheese: especially matured and hard cheese – the more matured the more histamine</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Tomatoes</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Smoked, cured meat, cured ham, salami</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Most fish products (all shell fish), especially preserved fish products</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Beans and pulses/legumes (especially chickpeas and soy beans, also peanuts)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Soy products (soy milk, soy cream, tofu, soy sauce)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Wheat products (bread, cakes, biscuits etc)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Pickles</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Ready meals</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Some fruit varieties (banana, pears, aubergines, oranges, kiwi, strawberries)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Alcohol, especially wine and beer</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Yeast</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Black tea</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Chocolate, cocoa</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Sweets with preservatives and/or food colourings</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Malt vinegar</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">◊ Nuts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now we know what causes the symptoms and what foods to avoid, what are the best remedies (aside from anti-histamine tablets)?  From low-histamine foods, helpful vitamins and homeopathic remedies, it can be a lengthy (not to mention expensive) process of finding what works best for you. Below are some of the treatments some people swear by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eating low-histamine food such as:</strong></p>
<p>◊ Vitamin C-rich foods such as kiwi, citrus and papaya</p>
<p>◊ Dark green, leafy vegetables</p>
<p>◊ Deep yellow and orange vegetables</p>
<p>◊ Nettles, bamboo shoots, cabbage, beets, carrots, yams</p>
<p>◊ Onions, garlic, ginger, cayenne, horseradish, licorice</p>
<p>◊ Pineapple</p>
<p>◊ Turmeric</p>
<p>◊ Probiotics</p>
<p>◊ Camomile, butterbur and peppermint</p>
<p>◊ Fresh fish, meat and poultry. The older the produce, the more histamine builds up in it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Taking immune-boosting supplements, vitamins and minerals such as:</strong></p>
<p>◊ Bioflavonoids (e.g., quercetin, catechin, and hesperidin)</p>
<p>◊ Flaxseed oil</p>
<p>◊ Probiotics (e.g. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus).  Probiotics are bowel microflora organisms—microscopic bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines.</p>
<p>◊ Omega 3, 6, 9</p>
<p>◊ Vitamin A</p>
<p>◊ Vitamin C</p>
<p>◊ Vitamin E</p>
<p>◊ Zinc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Direct treatments that work for some people:</strong></p>
<p>◊ Petroleum jelly on the eye lashes and nostrils</p>
<p>◊ Eye baths. I like to dampen a piece of cotton wool after I wash my face and gently wipe my eyelids with it. It can clear a lot more of the tiny pollen that gets trapped in the skin and causes itching than just washing your eyes alone</p>
<p>◊ Nasal drops</p>
<p>◊ Damp cotton wool in the outer canal of the ear to stop pollen getting in the inner canal and causing itching</p>
<p>◊ Red nasal light</p>
<p>◊ Local honey</p>
<p>◊ Acupuncture</p>
<p>◊ Salt pipe therapy</p>
<p>◊ HEPA air filters for the car and indoors. These can clean pollen and other allergens in the air inside the home or car. A Humidifier would similarly be helpful as it sprays cold steam into the air in your home and effectively cleans the tiny particles floating around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, months before the hayfever season begins you have to start a detox by eliminating foods that are high in histamines. Ideally you should do a colon cleanse too to ensure your bowel function and immune system is in good order. You then need to dose up on foods and minerals that help to break down histamines in the body so that when all that pollen starts flying around your body can handle it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny enough as my main trigger is grass pollen, on the days I manage to cut out wheat (i.e. no pasta, bread, cakes, biscuits etc), my symptoms aren’t too bad. Keeping dairy and sugar to a minimum also keeps me free of a congested head and nasal passage. This is because wheat, sugar and dairy all cause mucus to build up in our system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Without a doubt we all have our own unique approach to training; from why we train to the mentality we adopt while we train. The Training Philosophy Series will showcase a range of people who will share with us their own methods of training, what they love about training, what they find challenging, what helps them push through the pain barrier and some of the lighter moments they&#8217;ve experienced during their training sessions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kicking us off is 24 year-old Elliot Charles, professional footballer and personal trainer based in North London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How I got into training:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was always very sporty at school, representing my school and county in athletics.  I also played football but didn&#8217;t really take it too seriously until around 16/17 when I got into it more and it paid off as I turned pro at the age of 18.  I now play for Dover FC and the Grenadian national team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Methods &amp; Philosophy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-261 alignright" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4-300x200.jpg" alt="EC4" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4-300x200.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC4.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I train a different part of my body every day but while some people might do the same body part on a set day of the week, I change what days I do each muscle from week to week.  I find this works my muscles more efficiently and it also makes training less predictable and more fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Favourite aspect of training (self)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love training my legs. Despite the pain the following day, I just love the buzz I get from pushing myself to do another set. Somehow, training my legs releases a mad level of endorphins that training other parts of me doesn&#8217;t. On the other hand, I just don&#8217;t love training my core and abs as much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Favourite aspect of training (for football)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I <img class="  wp-image-259 alignright" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-300x300.jpg" alt="EC2" width="243" height="243" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-49x49.jpg 49w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2-130x130.jpg 130w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" />love the technical aspect of football training. I find this part of training much more relevant to my development as a footballer than the long running drills we often do. I get that the running improves my heart rate and endurance, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But I just prefer spending time on practicing specific skills and techniques required in playing a world-class standard of football and just love having the ball at my feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Funniest thing I&#8217;ve seen while training</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-258 alignleft" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1-300x208.jpg" alt="EC1" width="300" height="208" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1-300x208.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EC1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ll never forget the time a guy was clearly showing off, trying to bench press what was obviously more than his maximum.  Next thing we all heard him screaming for help as he struggled to bring the barbell under control.  One of us had to rush over and help him to stop him almost killing himself with the weights.  I know really shouldn&#8217;t but I just wanted to cry with laughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nightmare kind of trainee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People who appear to &#8216;tire&#8217; easily and lack any real focus on &#8216;the job at hand&#8217; &#8211;  you know the kind of person who loves to take a break at the smallest sign of fatigue.  This disrupts the flow of the session and makes it hard to achieve fitness and training goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Idol</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My team-mate Terrell, who used to play in the premier league, still trains with the same dedication and focus you would expect of someone playing in the top flight.  He&#8217;s the first one in, last one to leave and gives more than 100% each session.  He is tireless in the practice and honing of his craft, is a great player and motivates me to do my best too.  His attitude, respect for his team and work rate is truly inspirational.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training Fuel</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I eat a protein rich diet consisting of chicken, fresh greens and healthy, unprocessed starches. I mainly drink water and juice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having fairly recently reinvented myself as a wellness and fitness professional, (but still a PR deep down) I thought it would be a cool thing to speak to a group of fantastic mothers I know and get them to talk about their fitness and post the article on mother&#8217;s day. How they got into keeping fit, why, who and what motivates them etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What I managed to get was a collection of truly fantastic stories from ten fabulous women who represent a range of all you women out there, whether you are a mum or not.  Each one has a different reason for keeping fit and a totally different approach to how they achieve this.  This was the story for me. The fact that you can have the same goal but have different reasons for having that goal and therefore take a totally different approach to the next person.  Different journeys to the same destination, but you all get there in your own way.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you so much to the ladies who contributed to this.  I have truly enjoyed putting this together and hope you enjoy reading it too. Happy Mother&#8217;s Day to all the mums out there!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_321" style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-321 " alt="Sara Ali" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_08241.jpg" width="288" height="384" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_08241.jpg 480w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_08241-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Sara Ali</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sara Ali, 30+, Retail Consultant and mother to 11 year old daughter + 8 year old son</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Luckily I have always been very slim and didn&#8217;t need to keep fit, which is just as well as I couldn&#8217;t think of a worse way to spend my time than willingly putting myself through pain and sweating. When I had my first child, I wasn&#8217;t too bothered about losing the extra half a stone I had put on as I was probably too skinny before and I also knew I wanted to have another child so there was no point in getting a six pack just to undo all that effort and have a big tummy again!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After I had my second child, I seemed to have put on more weight than previously and the weight just didn&#8217;t seem to come off as easy as it did with my first child. Finally I had empathy for what my friends and magazine covers were talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I knew was done in the baby-making department and was determined to shift the extra weight and get back into my skinny jeans but it didn&#8217;t happen for a while and it became a frustrating process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_320" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-320" alt="Sara with her niece" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_0031.jpg" width="360" height="480" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_0031.jpg 360w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_0031-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Sara with her niece</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hospitality is a huge part of the Arab culture and when a woman gives birth, the custom is for her to have 40 days rest to recover from the trauma of childbirth. During this period, the family would get an extended round of visits from family and friends who would bring food, come and help with any chores and give any emotional help and support needed.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A huge part of these visits involves eating the food that the visitors have brought (while they are still with you!) to show gratitude for their time and effort. As you can imagine, this means piling on a whole load of weight in the first couple of months of giving birth. I was having two breakfasts and two dinners at one stage!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">After the 40 days, there then tends to be a lot of invites to family type events with the idea being to get the mother and child back out and socialising which can also help prevent post-natal depression. I often just put on a nice pretty kaftan, convincing myself I was being a good Arab wife and mum when really it was just a way to hide the extra pounds and not bother do anything about it for as long as I could hide it under a swathe of fabric.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2762.jpg"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-325" alt="IMG_2762" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2762.jpg" width="307" height="287" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2762.jpg 512w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2762-300x280.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /></span></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When my son was a few years old, I decided to separate from my husband and I moved with the children to leafy Chiswick. This was life-changing in many ways. It was amazing watching people running by the river, looking like they were in a completely serene zone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was also inspired by the many mums I saw running with their prams and thought, wow, I have no excuse not to get fit. Having watched my mum suffer years of ill health from not taking care of her wellbeing (using the fact that she’d had five kids as her reason to be overweight), and not liking the feeling of discomfort when I put my clothes on, I joined the riverside jogging herd and also joined a gym.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_322" style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-322 " alt="Abs in the making..." src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_15581.jpg" width="288" height="384" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_15581.jpg 480w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_15581-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Abs in the making&#8230;</span></p></div>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396103222009_13130" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I would go 3-4 times a week, spending an hour and half in the gym by splitting my time between cardio, light weights and stretching. As much as I enjoyed jogging by the river, I preferred using the cardio machines more with the simple reason being that I wanted to be able to track my progress. I needed to see numbers, how fast I’m going, how much I’m burning etc. I loved working out alone and found the time by myself a great way to relax and refocus.  Being a single mum and self-employed can be stressful and you can totally forget to make time for yourself.</span></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396103222009_13124" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also reduced my sugar intake and cut out a lot of the processed starches that is prevalent in my culture. It meant also cutting down how much coffee I drank which was hard as I love my caffeine.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; color: #000000;">One of the amazing mums I met, who is now a good friend, is a personal trainer and a shining example of holistic wellness.  She would take me to health food shops and introduce me to weird and wonderful things I’d never heard of or ever thought I would be eating. She truly motivates me to stay healthy as she is mum of three, runs her own business and still takes good care of herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_308" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-308    " alt="Angela Cozier" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ACGOD2012-045.jpg" width="311" height="467" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ACGOD2012-045.jpg 2400w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ACGOD2012-045-200x300.jpg 200w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ACGOD2012-045-682x1024.jpg 682w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ACGOD2012-045-940x1410.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Angela Cozier</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I started working out 17 years ago mainly to keep healthy. After the birth of my daughter, the training aim then became one of weight loss to regain my figure. Although I trained regularly, going to aerobics classes etc, it’s not until almost four years ago when I did Shaun T’s Insanity that I finally lost most of my excess body weight. My husband has also suffered with colitis for many years and, along with our new keep-fit regime, I started the whole family on a clean eating programme.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For many years I was a Business Systems Analyst but felt like I needed a change. My journey in becoming fit and healthier through fitness and clean eating compelled me to share my new found knowledge with the world. I completed a diploma in Nutritional Therapy in 2013 and set up my own business as a Nutritional Adviser shortly after in the same year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I tend to train six days a week, especially if I’m following a programme (Insanity, P90x Chalean Extreme etc) and when I train al fresco, I do a mix of high intensity interval training, weights and stretching. I train fasted to allow for maximum fat burn and break my fast with a spread consisting of a large portion of protein and fresh vegetables.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My motivation for training is simply to stay healthy, especially to be healthy and be there for my family. It’s also so I can motivate others by being an example of the life I preach.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_255" style="width: 183px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-255  " alt="Angela on holiday in 2012" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AC1.jpeg" width="173" height="230" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AC1.jpeg 480w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AC1-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Angela on holiday in 2012</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I love training my legs as I can lift heavier weights during squats/lunges but I really don’t like working on my abs. Shaun T and Chalene Johnson inspire me with their approach to fitness. Chalene especially as she’s also a mum and business owner as well as being supremely fit!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I joined the gym for the first time ever in my life in January this year just to tone up generally.  My husband bought me the membership as a Christmas gift as he knew I wanted to get fitter. I have always been slim and weighed around 48-50 kilos but when I had my twin boys 7 years ago, my weight shot up to 70 kilos!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I managed to shed the excess 20 kilos I had gained just four months after having my boys by simply exercised in the house. Not with a fitness DVD or anything boring like that!  I would walk up and down the stairs several times. I started off with going up and down around 20 times, gradually increasing the number to 50, then 100 times. While sitting down watching TV, I would be doing leg raises and triceps dips as I found TV a total waste of time. I also love dancing, especially salsa and would try and go whenever possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Luckily, I am also not a big fan of sugar and I have always eaten very healthily. I cook everything from scratch and rarely do ready meals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I am enjoying going to the gym now as I have used a personal trainer who has shown me how to get the most out of my sessions in the gym.  I love working on my legs but don’t like press ups or floor work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"> My husband is my inspiration. Rain, snow or sunshine, he goes out jogging. He didn’t  put any pressure on me to lose the baby weight but seeing him so dedicated to his fitness motivated me to also get fit. He has even helped his brother lose a lot of excess weight by encouraging him to take up jogging as well.</span></p>

<div id="attachment_293" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-293" alt="NF3" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NF3.png" width="212" height="396" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NF3.png 212w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NF3-160x300.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Natasha Foster</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;ve always been active since my school days. After the birth of my second child, I needed an outlet and to do an activity for <strong>me</strong>.  I used to do Judo as a child and thought about doing it again but wanted to do something more athletic and involving kicking, probably because I liked watching martial arts films so much!  I took up Tang Soo Do as a new years resolution after being introduced to it by a friend and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I was never interested in going to the gym or aerobic type classes so this was a perfect alternative to spending hours each week in a gym or group class.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I train 3-4 times a week, increasing it to 6-9 times a week when I’m preparing for an event such as tournament etc. My training includes swimming, running and martial arts. My favourite part of training is working on my legs and stomach as these are my strongest points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Exercise is a huge part of my life. When I&#8217;m not able to train it really affects my mood. The only time I am happy not to train is when I go on holiday, although I love swimming on holiday too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Master Duane Maynard, one of my Tang Soo Do instructors is a true inspiration.  He&#8217;s a machine! I admire his determination and huge achievements as a martial arts professional. My training partner Deanne is also an inspiration with her steely determination and stubbornness for achieving her goals. I am also surrounded by friends with amazing discipline and focus on getting the results they want in every area of their lives. This motivates to keep doing my best too.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have a naturally high metabolism and eat pretty much what I like. Having said that, I do eat a very balanced diet. I increase my calorie intake, especially protein and water intake, when training for an event.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My introduction to exercise came via my grandfather’s girlfriend when I was thirteen. At that point, I was experiencing really painful menstrual pains and my grandfather’s girlfriend explained to me that exercising would help as it would improve me body’s circulation and help to ease the pain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I remember thinking the woman was crazy as she had me doing jumping jacks but I did it anyway and went to the leisure centre a few times. I didn&#8217;t really keep it up but a few years later I joined the local leisure centre and really loved step and aerobic classes. I have been keeping fit ever since and went on to qualify as a personal trainer.</span></p>

I prefer this to the high intensity interval training programmes as I haven’t found them to really work for me.  I love working on my lower body but I’m not keen on core work. I really admire Davina Mcall for her work in promoting fitness. I like the fact that she doesn&#8217;t appear to just be doing it for money and love the example she sets with all her charity work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I joined the gym following a referral from the GP to help with my back pain and also to help me get off anti-depressants which I had been on for over 8 years. I went to the gym every day, training for 3 hours at a time and lost 20 kilos within 7 months.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I love training and see it as part of my lifestyle. I love seeing the results of my hard work, constantly challenge myself and enjoy doing bootcamps, salsa and boxing along with working out in the gym. My favourite exercise is abs and floor work with weights. I’m not so keen on using the bike and spin classes! My constant motivation is the desire never to be a size 16-18 ever again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My favourite part of my body is my legs as so many people tell me it looks amazing, which always makes me feel good. I don’t like my bingo wings much though! I work so hard on it and still it’s not as firm as I’d like to be. I am inspired by people like Jessica Ennis.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; text-align: justify; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">I started working out in my twenties mainly to keep fit. During my pregnancy, I kept up my fitness by going swimming. Just a few months after having my youngest son, I returned to the gym just to tone up as I had lost all the baby weight already.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I train 3 times a week and love going to classes such as body pump and I am currently working with a personal trainer to improve my muscle tone and build up my legs.  I like working on my legs, bums and arms as those are the body parts I would like to change the most.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I’m not a major fitness fanatic. I just like to keep in shape, especially recently as it feels like my body doesn’t burn off the calories the way it used to when I was younger. Luckily, having kids hasn’t changed my body much but I do want to build up my legs and bum and tone up my arms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I would love to look like Rhianna, one of the class instructors at my gym. She’s very slim like me but super toned all over. I am also inspired by lots of different fit people who I follow on Instagram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Luckily I can pretty much eat what I like and not put on much weight. I cook everything from scratch and I eat loads of fresh vegetables with different kinds of protein and rice. I don’t do ready meals or fried food but do love the occasional sweet treat.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">I tend to train five days a week, splitting my training between Tang Soo Do and the gym.  My favourite exercise &#8211; I love to sprint &#8230; I just love to sprint ! Sprinting provides me with a good cardiovascular workout, gets the heart pumping and the legs working!!  I do not actually have an exercise that I do not like.  When I’m focused and in a zone, I just get on and do what I need to do.  No pain, no gain right?!</span></p>

I am currently following a number of fitness instructors on Facebook and my main reason for this is to become more knowledgeable in helping me get closer to my own long term fitness goal.  However from a karate perspective, I would have to say Gichin Funakoshi, &#8220;the father of karate&#8221; is a real inspiration.  Master Funakoshi&#8217;s struggle to refine and popularise the art of karate is a fine example of persevering and striving for what you believe in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I think I have a very balanced diet. I tend to have six small meals a day, consisting of protein, carbs and good fats. I also mainly drink water and herbal teas, rather than juices or fizzy drinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rosemary Patten, 60+, Holistic business owner, mother to daughter aged 30+</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My first attempt at keeping fit was when I took up badminton in my 30s and I did it for about 3 years. I loved the game but eventually gave up as I just didn’t have the strength and competitive edge you need to win games. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I then took up yoga and swimming which I liked much more as both are individual activities where the only competition is yourself. I am not a huge fan of aerobic type classes as I don’t really have the co-ordination you seem to need at some of these fast-paced classes and I just feel silly when I can’t keep up. I find swimming quite a peaceful activity, especially when there’s hardly anyone in the pool.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I had to stop going, however as I couldn’t go on a regular basis due to the difficulty in juggling my part time work, being a wife and mother and the unpredictable working hours of my husband’s job.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Around 12 years ago, with my daughter now all grown up and more of my own time to myself, I went back to doing yoga and swimming and have been going regularly since. I go to yoga twice a week and swimming once a week, depending on what client bookings, meetings or other commitments I have that week. I love the standing poses in yoga the best but I’m not a huge fan of core exercises as it’s my weakest area.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_314" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-314 " alt="Rosemary, right, at yoga" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RP1a.jpg" width="614" height="461" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RP1a.jpg 1024w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RP1a-300x225.jpg 300w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RP1a-940x705.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Rosemary, right, at yoga</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">I truly appreciate the value of exercise, especially as you get older. Diabetes, high blood pressure, impaired cognitive function and certain types of cancers are all more prevalent as you get older. Your body is also not as strong or toned as when you are younger and exercising is a great way to stay healthy, both physically and mentally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Linda and some of the ladies in my yoga class (who are a few years older than me!) are inspirational in how fit they are for their age. Some of them do weights in the gym as well as yoga and have incredibly fit and strong bodies. They can manage some of the more difficult moves in yoga due to their strength and flexibility. Another inspiration is my close friend who is 70 and has been playing badminton from since our children were really young. Although I stopped, she’s still playing and is as fit and brilliant at it as ever!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Generally, I don’t eat less than two hours before I exercise, so on the days I am going to work out, I eat my breakfast earlier than normal and then have a small snack after. I don’t eat anything else until my dinner which tends to be freshly prepared meats, fresh vegetables and not too much starches.</span></p>

<div id="attachment_267" style="width: 186px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-267    " alt="Lorenza competing for Mrs Malta" src="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LA4.jpeg" width="176" height="265" srcset="http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LA4.jpeg 1360w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LA4-199x300.jpeg 199w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LA4-680x1024.jpeg 680w, http://coachloreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LA4-940x1415.jpeg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Lorenza competing for Mrs Malta</span></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">It’s fair to say staying fit has always been a part of my life. I started dancing when I was 13 and worked as a professional dancer for eight years before stopping after the birth of my son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">I currently train six times a week doing weight training, muay thai and Tang Soo Do. My favourite exercise is leg training but with a current shoulder injury, upper body work is my least favourite.  I follow a high protein, low carb diet and have to eat every two hours because of the sheer amount of energy I burn every day.  Training and dieting go hand in hand, you can&#8217;t have one without the other.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Training is my life. I love the full contact aspect and explosive power involved in doing muay thai. I also love the traditional element to Tang Soo Do and the self defence techniques it teaches, especially learning how to use weapons. In the ten years I have been doing Tang Soo Do, the training involved in attaining the senior belts has taken me on some unforgettable journeys.  I am inspired by different people for various reasons. From a martial arts background, I feel Bruce Lee  is a true inspiration.  His agility, knowledge and determination to bring martial arts to the Western world are truly inspiring.   From a fitness point of view Andreia Brazier is someone I aspire to. I admire her dedication, mental strength and focus.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life’s journey is an amazing treasure.  A gift of time given to us to be here on earth to learn and grow.</p>
<p>How to move steadily through life while keeping pace with the demands of our work, home and relationships. It is a challenge we are all faced with and yet not all of us manage to strike the right balance. At different stages and ages in our lives, we choose to navigate this world at a pace we find optimal at that moment. For example, haring through our teens and twenties, powerwalking in our thirties and forties and steady stepping in our fifties and sixties. The key is our state of mind. So much is written and said about this and yet the only thing that really matters is being in control.</p>
<p>A steady pace means you can see the fuller picture and choose each path with confidence and ease. It allows you to swerve the negative energies that inevitably comes our way, suck in any disappointment, wallow a little in it if you so choose, then dust yourself off and go on. The world around us feeds our minds visually and aurally, impacting on our emotions and thereby affecting our wellbeing. Technological advancement is shaping our consumption of information. So-called smartphones, mobile phones with a myriad of functions including access to the internet, can mean a bombardment of all sorts of information.  A lot of this information is designed to manipulate the way the consumer feels and being aware of this is a key step in maintaining good mental health.</p>
<p>Understanding that what you feed your eyes, ears and therefore mind with is the difference between feeling like you’re running uphill and getting nowhere fast and purposefully walking in the right direction.</p>
<p>In my next post, let’s begin to explore exactly how information you take in affects your life. Namaste.</p>
